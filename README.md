I’m a graduate student at RIT studying Computer Science, passionate about breaking into the tech industry and building software that solves real-world problems at the intersection of data, engineering, and user experience.

Right now, I’m building apps with SwiftUI and expanding my skills in machine learning and data science.

I’m eager to apply my skills to impactful software engineering challenges, grow through collaboration, and contribute to mission-driven work. Always open to connecting with peers, mentors, and opportunities in software engineering.
